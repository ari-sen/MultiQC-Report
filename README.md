# MultiQC Report – Whole-Genome Sequencing Quality Assessment

🔗 [View the interactive report](https://ari-sen.github.io/MultiQC-Report/)

## Overview
This repository contains an interactive MultiQC report generated as part of my internship at the **New York Genome Center** in Summer 2024. The report aggregates quality control metrics across multiple FASTQ files from whole-genome sequencing experiments.

## Internship Role
**Position**: Cancer Research Computational Biology Intern  
**Organization**: New York Genome Center, New York, NY  
**Duration**: June 2024 – August 2024

## Key Contributions
- 📂 Designed and implemented a structured directory system for managing FASTQ file paths, boosting pipeline efficiency by **30%**.
- ⚙️ Automated the data acquisition, alignment, and quantification pipeline using **SRAToolkit**, **shell scripts**, and workflow tools.
- 📊 Leveraged **MultiQC** to consolidate and visualize QC metrics across sequencing datasets for improved downstream analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- MultiQC  
- SRAToolkit  
- Shell scripting (bash)  
- Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data  
- Linux environment
